There are five programs that demonstrate the use of various pthread
commands and synchronization opeartions. 

pgm1.c: The main thread creates two new threads. The main thread writes whole
numbers in a file called whole_num, one thread executes odd( ) function that 
writes odd numbers in a file called odd_num, and the other thread executes 
even( ) function that writes even numbers in a file called even_num.

pgm2.c: Same as pgm1 except that the threads are created with specific 
parameters instead of default parameters, and write on the standard output. 

pgm3.c: Same as pgm2 except that the threads used mutexes to synchronize 
their writes. Explain the difference in the outputs between pgm2 and pgm3.

pgm4.c: A solution for producer consumer problem using pThreads. In this 
program the buffer is of size 1. Modify the program for a buffer of size
larger than 1.

pgm5.c: A solution for dining philosophers problem suing pThreads. How is this
solution different from the one we discussed in class.

Run make to compile, or use the following command for each program:

   gcc -o object_filename filename -lpthread
