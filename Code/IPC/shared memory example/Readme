These programs illustrates the usage of shared memory between two process
in Linux. There are two files containing C programs, client.c and server.c.
The server process creates a shared membery segment and writes some characters
in it. It then waits for the first character in the shared memory to become
'*', and then exits. The client process reads characters from this shared
memory and prints them out on the terminal, writes '*' at the beginning of
the shared memory segment, and then exits.

Compile these programs using the makefile provided and then run them on
two different terminals. First run the server program and then the client
program.
